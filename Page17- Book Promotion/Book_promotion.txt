Having bought a Raspberry Pi, chances are that you will be interested in learning how to program your new gadget. The book ‘Programming the Raspberry Pi: Getting Started with Python’ by Simon Monk, guides the reader through the process of learning Python with the Raspberry Pi.The book is accessible to newcomers to programming and leads the reader through the basics of Python, before moving on to more complex topics such as using the Tkinter and Pygame libraries as well as programming for the GPIO connector.The approach is very much hands-on. Programming concepts are developed in example programs, which build from a simple start in the same way as you would when writing a program from scratch.Three chapters of the book are devoted exclusively to programming and using the GPIO connector. Various techniques, tools and prototyping products are surveyed and explained, including Gertboard, PiFace, Pi Cobbler and the RaspiRobotBoard. Two of the hardware chapters are step-by-step instructions for building and programming hardware projects using the GPIO connector. The first project is a simple 7-segment LED display that displays the Raspberry Pi’s system time. The second is a roving robot that uses the low cost Magician Chassis rover kit, along with the RaspiRobotBoard interface board. All the source code from the book is available as a download from the book’s website.The book is available from most major book sellers from the end of November 2012 and further details can be found at the books website (www.raspberrypibook.com). Attachments - Pi-based Rover Project, Falling Raspberries game, Cover.
