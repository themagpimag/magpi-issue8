The only thing I need to put in is descriptions, but I need a bit of help with what pics work and fitting them in, grouped if need be.

The cases are self explanatory, the cake was for an Halloween party they were going to (at least I think it was Halloween), the empty room is their new factory space with an office been built at the back (their current factory space is to be converted into an hackspace), the packaging pics are for retail and mail-order (the unused packaging is retail), the laser cut parts are laser cut parts, the picade pics are to show what the kickstarter was about, and the pic of the guys is a pic of the guys.

Regards,

Chris (tzj)

    Hi,

    The page numbers of the Pilbow article have been updated.  The scribus and pdf files have been uploaded to the dropbox.

    Chris, do you have any more text from the interview?  Can you put it in the dropbox?  This would allow one of us to finish the layout.

    Thanks and best regards,

    Will
