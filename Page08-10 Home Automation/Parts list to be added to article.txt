HI,

I've found the suitable parts on Maplin's site, but can't find
anything on Tandy.
Maplin parts...
VY48C – 433mhz transmitter and receiver £9.99. Bigger and more pins
than the ones I used, but the extra ones are duplicates of power
supplies.
DG41U – Floppy disk cable £3.99.
M1M – 1MOhm Resistor £0.29.

Regards,
Geoff.
