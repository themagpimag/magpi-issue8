To properly add them together
you'll need to shift all the bits in the second
register to the left by 8-bits (>>8).

This is extremely dubious. As I see it, it is little-endian, “least significant byte first”.

I think it should be <<8, as in the code sample above. The code looks right.

P22 - the C++ cache

[program_name] and [program-name] inconsistency

“If you get an error saying the file is not found” - The actual error would be something like:

gcc: error: test.cpp: No such file or directory

Should probably read “If you get an error saying no such file or directory...”

“DATABASE BOOTCAMP” (p25)

I disagree with some of what this article says, because it implies that SQL database tables are a list, which of course, they aren’t. They are a set of tuples, which is not the same as a list because it’s not inherently ordered and you can’t rely on the database presenting the rows in a fixed order unless you use ORDER BY.

“MySQL recognizes only three types of data: text, number and date”. Colon missing.

It’s also not really true, because there are other types which are fundamentally different, such as blobs or geospatial data.
